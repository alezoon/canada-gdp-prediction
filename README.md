# Canada GDP Prediction

Time series forecasting model predicting Canadian GDP growth using machine learning.

## Project Overview
This project analyzes 65 years of historical GDP data (1960-2024) to forecast Canada's economic growth through 2050 using linear regression.

## Key Results
- **R² Score:** 0.9073 (90.73% variance explained)
- **2050 GDP Projection:** $2.75 trillion USD
- Successfully captured long-term GDP growth trends

## Technologies
- Python (pandas, scikit-learn, numpy, matplotlib)
- Linear Regression modeling
- Time series analysis

## Features
- Data preprocessing from World Bank dataset
- Train/test split validation
- Model evaluation metrics (MSE, RMSE, MAE, R²)
- Future projections through 2050
- Visualization of historical vs predicted values

## Usage
```python
# Run the Jupyter notebook
jupyter notebook gdp_canada_prediction.ipynb
